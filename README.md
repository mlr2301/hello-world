# Megan Riley - Applied Data Science Master's Student at Bay Path University
Hello world! I am studying data science as a way to follow my interests and grow my career! My first exposure to the data science world was through a systems biology class at UC Santa Barbara where we used MatLab to model biological systems. This class was the first time a quantitative approach to biology was introduced to me and I was hooked! I graduated, got a job that I was qualified for and started teaching myself how to code. Three years later, I'm here, studying data science! I hope to acheive the following goals:
1. Understand in greater detail what data science actually is and what data scientists do
2. With this knowledge, I wish to develop a data science tool kit
3. Get a job where I apply my new knowledge to solve interesting problems
